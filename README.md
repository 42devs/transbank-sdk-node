# Why this?

because the official version in [Transbank Developers]() is in POO, and POO sucks, that is the only reason, so, if you want to use Functional programing and make better your bundles and times, this is a good option.

also we have native support to typescript

# Requirements

- nodejs lts but is build in node 16.13.0

## Dependencies:

- we try, but for now we only have axios as dependency

# Getting Started

install using `npm` or `yarn`

```bash
npm install transbank-sdk-node
yarn add transbank-sdk-node
```

you can read all the methods in the [docs](https://42devs.github.io/transbank-sdk-node)
